//Once the page had loaded for the user
// I want the main button start with the word "start" then have an onclick listener on so it can listen to change to word "enter" to enter the access code.
//Once the onclick listener has go off I want the timer to start counting down from 30 
//this will require a function to make a countdown clock
//use jquery to put it on the page

//this will need a function to make an array of 9 randomize numbers 
//and the 9 randomize number to appear on the page.
//(post on the page using jquery)
//put these array of randomize number in a global var so it can be compared for later use.
//then grab this array into a different function and it can pick random from the array
// putting this number in a global variable so the conditional can see if it is the match number.
//I need to set a few conditionals
//1. to see if the enter code matches one of the randomize codes 
//-stop clock
//put title to change to "you have stopped the bomb you are everyones hero"
//(celebrating gif) for 5 seconds restart game to start button
//2. if the clock got to zero
//-stop clock
//-change title to "you lost everyone"
//change bomb img to an exploding one
//5 seconds change button to start again
